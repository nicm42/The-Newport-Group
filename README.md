## General info
I wanted to make a multi-page website, partly because it's been a long time since I designed and created a site. I also learnt about doing some flashy things in CSS and since this is a luxury brand, it seemed like a good site to try them out on.
Since it was a multi-page site I intended to use the HTML template tag, but React seemed easier. Having just done a tutorial a little JSX would be the perfect introduction. And then I found it all needed to be in React...
